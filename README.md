# job-tracker
A Chrome extension that saves your jobs to your Trello boards. 

## How it works
Just click on the extension icon, enter the fields and it will add it to your decided Trello board.
What it currently adds: Job company, position, location, and the URL of the page where you applied the job. This information is added as a card to a list. 

### Does it work right now? 
If you're an end user looking to add jobs, NO. This extension is still under active development. A beta-version will come soon! 
If you're a developer, YES. You need to get your credentials, board and list IDs from Trello, fill them in `popup.js` and it should work! You're also welcome to contribute new features! The project is heavily docuemented, and I'll add in-progress and to-do items in the Projects section soon.
