## How it works
Just click on the extension icon, enter the fields and it will add it to your decided Trello board.
What it currently adds: Job company, position, location, and the URL of the page where you applied the job. This information is added as a card to a list. 

### Does it work right now? 
Yes! It's under review on Chrome webstore, and I'll update this page with the link once it's approved!
